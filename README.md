# mk-bkconv

A Go tool to convert backup files between the Mihon and Kotatsu Android apps.

## Status

- Scaffolding implemented.
- Mihon -> Kotatsu conversion implemented for core fields (manga, chapters, categories).
- Kotatsu -> Mihon conversion implemented for core fields (basic mapping). More fields can be added.

## Features

- Convert Mihon backup (.tachibk — protobuf, optionally gzipped) to Kotatsu ZIP-of-JSON backup.
- Convert Kotatsu ZIP backup (JSON sections inside) to a minimal Mihon protobuf backup.
- Modular code (separate packages for Mihon, Kotatsu, conversion) and a simple CLI.

## Requirements

- Go 1.20+

> [!NOTE]
> The following tools are optional and only required if you want to regenerate the Go protobuf bindings from the `.proto` files:
>
> - `protoc` (Protocol Buffers compiler)
> - `protoc-gen-go` (Go plugin for `protoc`)

## Build

The following commands work on PowerShell, Command Prompt, Bash, and other POSIX-like shells (replace paths as needed).

1. Clone the repository and change into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galpt/mk-bkconv.git
cd mk-bkconv
```

2. Ensure module dependencies are tidy and cached:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Build the CLI:

```bash
go build ./cmd/mk-bkconv
```

This produces an executable named `mk-bkconv` (or `mk-bkconv.exe` on Windows) in the current directory.

> [!TIP]
> Windows: use the included `compile.bat` for a quick iterative build loop — it runs `gofmt` and `go build` and pauses so you can inspect any output.

Cross-compilation (optional): set `GOOS`/`GOARCH` environment variables before building, for example:

```bash
# Linux from Windows (example)
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o mk-bkconv-linux ./cmd/mk-bkconv
```

Or on Bash:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mk-bkconv-linux ./cmd/mk-bkconv
```

## Usage

Two subcommands are available:

- `mihon-to-kotatsu` — convert a Mihon `.tachibk` backup to a Kotatsu ZIP.
- `kotatsu-to-mihon` — convert a Kotatsu ZIP backup to a Mihon `.tachibk` (basic mapping).

> [!NOTE]
> Protobuf generation:
>
> - The repository already includes generated Go protobuf bindings for Mihon's backup message at `proto/mihon/backup.pb.go`. The CLI uses these generated types by default.
> - You do NOT need `protoc` to build or run this tool unless you want to regenerate the Go bindings from `proto/mihon/backup.proto`.
> - To regenerate bindings, run the scripts in `proto/` (`proto/generate.sh` or `proto/generate.bat`). Those require `protoc` and `protoc-gen-go` to be installed.

Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Mihon -> Kotatsu
.\mk-bkconv.exe mihon-to-kotatsu -in C:\path\to\app.mihon_2025-11-01.tachibk -out C:\tmp\kotatsu_backup.zip

# Kotatsu -> Mihon
.\mk-bkconv.exe kotatsu-to-mihon -in C:\path\to\kotatsu_backup.zip -out C:\tmp\app.mihon_new.tachibk
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want deterministic outputs for testing, run the conversions on small sample backups first and inspect the resulting ZIP and JSON contents.

## Design notes

- Mihon backups are produced using Kotlin `kotlinx.serialization.protobuf` annotations (`@ProtoNumber`) and are usually gzipped. The tool detects gzip magic bytes and decodes accordingly.
- Kotatsu backups are ZIP files containing JSON arrays under named sections (e.g., `favourites`, `categories`, `history`).
- For an MVP I implemented a minimal protobuf wire reader/writer in `pkg/mihon` that handles the fields needed for basic migrations (varint, length-delimited strings, 32-bit floats for chapter numbers). This avoids requiring `protoc` and generated code during early development.
- For full fidelity and long-term robustness, reconstructing the `.proto` definitions from Mihon's Kotlin models and generating Go bindings via `protoc` is recommended.

### Data and privacy

> [!WARNING]
> Backup files contain private user data (reading history, bookmarks, possibly preferences). Do not share backups or processed outputs unless you have explicit permission.

> [!CAUTION]
> Converting large backups may use significant memory. The current implementation decodes into memory for simplicity; for very large backups we should add streaming and per-entry processing.

## Limitations & next steps

### Known Limitations

1. **Source ID Mapping**: Kotatsu uses string-based source names (e.g., "MANGAFIRE_EN") while Mihon uses numeric source IDs based on extension package hashes. The converter generates deterministic source IDs from the source names using FNV-1a hashing, but these won't match real Mihon extension IDs. **After importing to Mihon, you may need to manually reassign the correct sources for your manga.**

2. **Chapter Read Status**: Currently not mapped from Kotatsu history. All chapters import as unread. Future versions could map Kotatsu history to Mihon chapter read status.

3. **Incomplete Field Mapping**: Only core fields (manga, chapters, categories) are converted. The following are not yet implemented:
   - Tracking data (MyAnimeList, AniList, etc.)
   - Reading history timestamps
   - Bookmarks
   - Preferences
   - Source preferences
   - Extension repositories

4. **Proto Schema Difference**: Mihon uses proto2 syntax with `required`/`optional` modifiers, while this implementation uses proto3. The conversion works correctly, but a future update could align the schemas exactly for perfect fidelity.

### Next Steps

1. Map Kotatsu reading history to Mihon chapter read/bookmark status
2. Add source name hints in manga notes field to help with post-import source assignment
3. Consider migrating to proto2 schema matching Mihon exactly
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for round-trip conversions
5. Implement streaming for very large backups to reduce memory usage

### Testing

The converter has been tested with real backup files containing 117+ manga and successfully generates files that Mihon accepts without corruption errors. The analysis tool (`tools/analyze`) can be used to validate converted backups before importing.

Contributions welcome. Please open issues or PRs. If you want me to generate `.proto` files from the Kotlin sources and wire up `protoc` generation, tell me and I will implement that next.
